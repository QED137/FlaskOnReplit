# FlaskOnReplit
Welcome to our GitHub repository! Here, we've stored all the code for a website we built using a platform called Replit, which is a cloud-based development environment. This website is special because it's not just a regular webpage â€“ it's what we call a "full-stack" webpage. That means it has both a front end (the part you see and interact with) and a back end (the behind-the-scenes part that makes things work).

On the front end, we've used technologies like HTML (which gives the webpage its structure), CSS (which makes it look nice), and JavaScript (which adds interactive features like buttons and animations).

But what makes this website really cool is the back end. We've used something called Flask, which is like a magic engine that runs on the server (a powerful computer somewhere on the internet). Flask helps us do things like handle user input, process data, and respond to requests from the front end.

So, when you visit our website, you're actually interacting with both the front end and the back end at the same time!

In this repository, you'll find all the files and code we used to create this website. You can explore it, learn from it, and even use it as a starting point for your own projects. We've also included instructions on how to run the website yourself and make changes if you want to customize it.
