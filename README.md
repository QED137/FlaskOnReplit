# Cloud-Based Full-Stack with Flask on Replit
Welcome to our GitHub repository! Here, we've stored all the code for a website we built using a platform called Replit, which is a cloud-based development environment. This website is special because it's not just a regular webpage â€“ it's what we call a "full-stack" webpage. That means it has both a front end (the part you see and interact with) and a back end (the behind-the-scenes part that makes things work).

On the front end, we've used technologies like HTML (which gives the webpage its structure), CSS (which makes it look nice), and JavaScript (which adds interactive features like buttons and animations).
